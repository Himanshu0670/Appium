## Mobile Testing

### Mobile Web App :- 
Web apps rely on web browsers as their user interface. They need the internet to perform tasks. The best
thing about web apps is that they can run on various devices like computers, phones, and tablets. Additionally,
they can adjust to the screen size, whether a desktop computer or a smartphone.

### Native App :-
They are more customized apps that are dedicated to specific operating systems. For example, if an app is
made for Android, it's all run only in Android devices. The same rule applies to iOS - it's exclusively for Apple's
iPhones and iPads.

### Hybrid App :-
Hybrid apps combine elements from the web and native apps. They are built using a wide range of front-end
technologies. In other words, developers don't have to maintain or create a separate code base for Android
and iOS, meaning that developers can write the mobile app code once and make it work on multiple
platforms.

### What is Mobile Testing :-
Mobile testing is the process by which applications for modern mobile devices are
tested for functionality, usability, performance etc.


## Approaches to Test the mobile application
 Mobile application testing can be automated or manual, and helps you ensure that the application you're
 delivering to users meets all business requirements as well as user expectations.
 
### Manual Testing :- 
Manual testing is a human process. The primary focus of manual testing is on the experience of the user. Manual
testing can take advantage of human intuitiveness to uncover unexpected errors, but can also be extremely time-
consuming.

### Automated Testing :-
Automated testing saves much of this time and is particularly effective on repetitive tests, but can miss less
obvious cases that manual testing might catch.

### What is APK :- 
APK stands for `Android Package Kit` or `Android Application Package` created
for the Android operating system. Android uses this file extension to distribute and
install apps. Therefore, an АРК contains all the elements an app requires to be
installed correctly.
The developer typically uses `Android Studio` to create an Android app. Once the
app is ready, Android Studio compiles the application and puts it into one container
as an APK. APKs can have any name with the file extension **.apk**.

## Real Device Vs Simulator Vs Emulator Testing

### Real Device Testing :-
Testing performed on physical device i.e. your handset.Real device testing assures you that your application will work smoothly on customer handset.

### Simulator & Emulator Testing :-
Simulators & Emulators are not an actual devices. Simulators & Emulators are virtual devices. Virtual device are not real phones but they are software which gives functionalities as real phone (except few functionality like camera...)

- **Android virtual device are `Emulator`**
- **iOS virtual device are `Simulator`**
